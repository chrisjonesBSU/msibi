MSIBI: Multi-state Iterative Boltzmann Inversion
=============================================================================================

**MSIBI** is a Python package that implements the Multi-state Iterative Boltzmann Inversion (MS-IBI) method for coarse-graining in molecular dynamics.

This implementation provides an intuitive Python API for running iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) across multiple states (MS-IBI) or a single state. It is designed to make it easy to chain together multiple optimization runsâ€”for example, you can first optimize a coarse-grained bond-stretching interaction, then hold it fixed while optimizing other interactions like bond bending or non-bonded pair potentials.

MSIBI uses the HOOMD-blue simulation engine under the hood for coarse-grained simulations; however, it does not require that the target (atomistic) simulations are also performed with HOOMD-blue. The resulting coarse-grained potentials are exported in a tabulated format compatible with other simulation engines such as LAMMPS and GROMACS.
